# Resources


## Openly available resources related to Gravitational Wave Astronomy, Astrophysics, Cosmology etc 

- The [annual ICTS schools on Gravitational Wave Astronomy](https://www.icts.res.in/program/gws), being held yearly since 2013. Topics covered include GW detector science to data analysis to theoretical astrophysics. All lectures, problem sets, assignments are openly available.

- [An introduction to Bayesian inference in gravitational-wave astronomy: parameter estimation, model selection, and hierarchical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02293) by Eric Thrane and Colm Talbot.

- A [series of reviews](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=1&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=data+analysis+recipes&terms-0-field=title&terms-1-operator=AND&terms-1-term=david+hogg&terms-1-field=author&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-announced_date_first) on *Data Analysis Recipes* by David Hogg and collaborators. These are extremely fun to read through, while also being highly illuminating about the very basics of things.

- [The Open Astrophysics Bookshelf](https://open-astrophysics-bookshelf.github.io/) contains a few full-length textbook-like documents on star formation, computational hydrodynamics etc. I have read the one on [Introduction to Computational Astrophysical Hydrodynamics](http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/hydro_by_example/CompHydroTutorial.pdf) by Michael Zingale and it is fantastic.
