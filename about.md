My name is Aditya Vijaykumar.

- I was born in **Perinthalmanna, Kerala**, but lived in **Pune, Maharashtra** till I went to college.

- I currently reside in Toronto, where I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/) (CITA). I did my PhD in Physics at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://icts.res.in/) (ICTS-TIFR) in the [Astrophysical Relativity](https://www.icts.res.in/research/astrorel) group. 

- I was an undergraduate student at **Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani**, where I had **Physics** and **Mechanical Engineering** as my majors. 

- I work on various physics and astrophysics aspects of gravitational waves. My work involves both theory and computation, as well as an understanding of experimental data from gravitational-wave detectors. More information about my research can be found [here](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/research/).

- Apart from academic research, I used to direct and act in stage-theatre productions with the theatre outfit StageCraft in Bangalore ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stagecraftncbs/) [Instagram](https://www.facebook.com/stagecraftncbs/)). I used to also run a weekly podcast called [Cut to Scene](https://linktr.ee/cuttoscene). Check my [non-academic page](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/nonacademic/) for more.
