My name is Aditya Vijaykumar. To reach out digitally, use `aditya [at] utoronto [dot] ca`.

1. I work on various physics and astrophysics aspects of gravitational waves. My work involves both theory and computation, as well as an understanding of experimental data from gravitational-wave detectors. More information about my research [can be found here](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/research/).

1. I currently reside in Toronto, where I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/) (CITA).

1. I did my PhD in Physics at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://icts.res.in/) (ICTS-TIFR) in the [Astrophysical Relativity](https://www.icts.res.in/research/astrorel) group mentored by Prof. [Ajith Parameswaran]([url](https://home.icts.res.in/~ajith/Home.html)).
   * My PhD thesis titled _Probing gravity, astrophysics, and cosmology with gravitational waves_ was conferred the **2024 Justice Oak Award for Outstanding thesis in Astronomy** by the **Astronomical Society of India (ASI)**, as well as the **2024 V. V. Narlikar Best Thesis Award** by the **Indian Association for General Relativity and Gravitation (IAGRG)**.
    * During my PhD, I spent ~8 months as a Fulbright-Nehru Doctoral Research Fellow at The University of Chicago in the group of Prof. [Daniel Holz](https://holzlab.uchicago.edu/).

1. I am from India. I was born in **Perinthalmanna, Kerala**, but lived in **Pune, Maharashtra** till I went to college.

1. I was an undergraduate student at **Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani**, where I majored in **Physics** and **Mechanical Engineering**. 

1. Apart from academic research, I used to direct and act in stage-theatre productions with the theatre outfit StageCraft in Bangalore ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stagecraftncbs/) [Instagram](https://www.facebook.com/stagecraftncbs/)). I used to also run a weekly podcast called [Cut to Scene](https://linktr.ee/cuttoscene). I am passionate about cinema and try to watch a lot of movies (in the theatre) and [log them here](https://letterboxd.com/adivijaykumar/).
