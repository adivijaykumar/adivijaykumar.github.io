My name is Aditya Vijaykumar.

- I was born in **Perinthalmanna, Kerala** in 1995, but have lived in **Pune, Maharashtra** all my life.

- I currently reside in the city of **Bengaluru, Karnataka**, where I am pursuing my PhD in Physics at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://icts.res.in/) (ICTS-TIFR). If you are ever in Bengaluru and want to break away from the hustle and bustle of the city, I suggest you visit our campus to enjoy our hospitality and also learn about some interesting science being done. ICTS also has a plethora of [public events](https://icts.res.in/outreach) which you could be interested in.

- I was an undergraduate student at **Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani**, where I had **Physics** and **Mechanical Engineering** as my majors. 

- I work on various physics and astrophysics aspects of gravitational-waves. My work involves both theory and computation, as well as a deep understanding of experimental data from gravitational-wave detectors. More information about my research can be found [here](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/research/).

- I also direct and act in stage-theatre productions with the theatre outfit ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stagecraftncbs/) [Instagram](https://www.facebook.com/stagecraftncbs/)). I also like reading, and thinking about art of cinema. Check my [non-academic page](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/nonacademic/) for more.
