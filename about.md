title: About Me

---

My name is Aditya Vijaykumar.

- I was born in **Perinthalmanna, Kerala** in 1995, but have lived in **Pune, Maharashtra** all my life. I am deeply fond of Pune and Kerala and feel a connect to both places.

- I am currently an undergraduate student at **Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani** pursuing **Physics** and **Mechanical Engineering** as my majors. Before this I was doing my schooling in Pune.

- Physics, specifically aspects of theoretical physics such as General Relativity and Quantum Theory of Fields, interest me quite a bit. Check my [academic page](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/academic/) for more.

- Starting July 2017, I will work as a project student at the Centre for High Energy Physics (CHEP) of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. This is a part of my Masters' thesis on some aspects of quantum gravity.

- I like reading, writing, listening to poetry (very recently), quizzing, and occasionally thinking about art of cinema and music. Check my [non-academic page](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/nonacademic/) for more.
